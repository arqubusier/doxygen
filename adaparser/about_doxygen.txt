When is code parser run?
========================

"Generating file sources" in doxygen.cpp

triggered by generateSourceFile() in FileDef
SOURCE_BROWSER in config file
CALL_GRAPH
CALLER_GRAPH
REFERNCES_RELATION
REFERENCED_BY_RELATION => Doxygen::parseSourcesNeeded

How is the include graph made?
==============================

Header sections added to the entitity graph.
Not sure how these are used.

The includes are picked up at the preprocessing stage in pre.l.

the includes are linked against the input files which are 
read before the preprocessing stage.

the includes are stored in FileDef objects in inputNameDict. The
latter is encapsulated in the doxygen singleton, so there is no 
direct access from the parser. 

Because of all of this, there does not seem to be an easy solution
to making an include graph in ada.
