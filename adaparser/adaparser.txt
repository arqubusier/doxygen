TODO
====

    * merge with current version of doxygen.
    
    * add tests that follow Doxygen's test format
    
    * OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR ada, for ada specific output
    
    * Support doxygen comments placed after declarations
    
    * Error handling
    
    * Syntax highlighting for codebrowser.
    
    * handle function overloading. When generating call graphs,
      currently there is no consideration that multiple functions
      might have the same name but with different parameters.
      to solve this the grammar needs to be extended to keep track
      of the types of the function arguments used in funtion calls.


    visualisation
    -------------
    * represent inheritance in doxygen
    * represent generics in doxygen
    * represent tasks in doxygen
    
    * Include packet dependency graph.
    
    
    grammar
    -------
    
    * pragmas (processing)
            pragma import 
    
    * exceptions (processing)
    * renaming (processing)
    
    * types (processing)
      real type definition "type Percent is delta 0.01 digits 5;"
      integer type definition  "type Int is range 1 .. 10;"
    * subtype declarations
    
    
    * generic units
    * generic packages
    * for use ....
    
    * task
        -including delay
    
    
        
        * quantified expression
            "B := (for all K in A'Range => A(K) = 0);" (ada 2012)
        * conditional expression (ada 2012)
        * aspect_defintion (ada 2012)

        OOP
        ---
        * abstract functions 
        * abstract records
        * interface type

Doing
=====

    * test use and with clauses

Done
====

* types real type definition and integer type definition (parsing, no processing)
* exceptions (parsing but no processing)
* char constant
* pragmas (parsing but not any processing)
* use
    * representation
    * library level
    * declaration level
        * type
* proper recognition of "name"
* various statements (abort, raise, extended return, exit)
* declare_blocks
* type/subtype definition
    - enums
    - arrays
    - records
    - access variables
* access variables
* expressions (except quantified/conditional expressions)
    - array, record and enum aggregates
    - allocator ("new")
* fix bug where function call graph doesn't appear 
    commit cbdf491ba076921aee6b38b7d04b02e10c142f4

* find and fix cause of segfaults when running ada_test.
