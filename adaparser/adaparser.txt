TODO
====

* merge with current version of doxygen.

* Include packet dependency graph.

* Syntax highlighting for codebrowser.

* handle function overloading. When generating call graphs,
  currently there is no consideration that multiple functions
  might have the same name but with different parameters.
  to solve this the grammar needs to be extended to keep track
  of the types of the function arguments used in funtion calls.

* add language features:
    - type/subtype definition
    - access variables
    - records
    - abstract, tagged records

Doing
=====
    - arrays



Done
====
* fix bug where function call graph doesn't appear 
    commit cbdf491ba076921aee6b38b7d04b02e10c142f4

* find and fix cause of segfaults when running ada_test.

* add build instructinos.
